		The solar empire of the United States has glimmered for beautiful centuries under the tender watch of its godray scions: The Presidents of the Solar States, appointed and nurtured by the Yellow Sun itself. But a faint discord has entered the landâ€™s divine harmonies, and the Presidents are being threatened and disgraced by dim malignancies. The long-exiled Verminstar is striking back against the Yellow Sun, conniving to upend celestial order and reinstate the swamp of Bedlam. Now the Yellow Sun has birthed you out of a golden temple to set things right and protect his golden warmth.

		Your house needs a deck. You have a hammer. You have wood and you have nails. The light outside is faulty. You work, you earn. Freedom is $1,000,000.

		Build a deck. Use your hammer. Drive the nails in. Scrimp and save. Freedom is just around the corner.

		Upgrade your hammer, your hand, your nails. Squash a bug. Upgrade the bug. Squash it again. Say it with me: "Freedom is just around the corner."

		Keep your streak alive. The light is blinking. Listen to your nails. Cash out. $1,000,000, remember? Step by step. Hit your hand. Ignore the pain. Just around the corner.
